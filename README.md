# Start with Large Language Models (LLMs) - Become an expert for free!

## A complete guide to start and improve your LLM skills in 2023 without an advanced background in the field and stay up-to-date with the latest news and state-of-the-art techniques!

First, if you have 0 programming or AI knowledge, please follow [this guide](https://github.com/louisfb01/start-machine-learning) I made for this exact purpose and come back here!

This guide is intended for anyone with a small background in programming and machine learning. There is no specific order to follow, but a classic path would be from top to bottom. If you don't like reading books, skip them. If you don't want to follow an online course, you can also skip it. There is not a single way to become a machine learning expert, and with motivation, you can absolutely achieve it.

All resources listed here are free, except some online courses and books, which are certainly recommended for a better understanding, but it is definitely possible to become an expert without them, with a little more time spent on online readings, videos, and practice. When it comes to paying courses, the links in this guide are affiliated links. Please use them if you feel like following a course, as it will support me. Thank you, and have fun learning! Remember, this is completely up to you and not necessary. I felt like it was useful to me and maybe useful to others as well.

Don't be afraid to repeat videos or learn from multiple sources. Repetition is the key of success to learning!

## Prerequesites<a name="prerequesites"></a>

If you have 0 programming or AI knowledge, please follow [this guide](https://github.com/louisfb01/start-machine-learning) I made for this exact purpose. Check out the python section mostly and then you will have a strong enough background to come back here!

If you are somewhat familiar with Python and AI, then I wish you happy learning!


## Start with short YouTube video introductions<a name="youtubevideos"></a>
### Start with short YouTube videos introductions
This is the best way to start from nothing. Here, I list a few of the best videos I found that will give you a great first introduction to the terms you need to know to get started in the LLM field.
    
* Understanding the terminology
    * [Mastering AI Jargon - Your Guide to OpenAI & LLM Terms - What's AI](https://youtu.be/q4G6X09NEu4) - A quick introduction to the most used terms in the LLM (or GPT) world.
* Understanding Transformers and LLMs (i.e. models behind ChatGPT)!
   * [Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs8w1Cdi-zvYskDS2icIItfZgxclApVLv) - amazing video introductions to the attention mechanism, tokens, embeddings and more to better understand everything behind large language models like GPT by [Luis Serrano](https://twitter.com/SerranoAcademy).
   * [What are Transformer Models and how do they work?](https://youtu.be/qaWMOYf4ri8) - [Luis Serrano](https://twitter.com/SerranoAcademy)
   * [The Illustrated Word2vec - A Gentle Intro to Word Embeddings in Machine Learning](https://youtu.be/ISPId9Lhc1g) - A clear explanation of word embeddings in machine learning by [Jay Alammar](https://twitter.com/JayAlammar).

Another easy **way to get started and keep learning is by listening to podcasts** in your spare time. Driving to work, on the bus, or having trouble falling asleep? Listen to some AI podcasts to get used to the terms and patterns, and learn about the field through inspiring stories! I invite you to follow a few of the best I personally prefer, like [Lex Fridman](https://open.spotify.com/show/2MAi0BvDc6GTFvKFPXnkCL), [Machine Learning Street Talk](https://open.spotify.com/show/02e6PZeIOdpmBGT9THuzwR), and obviously, my podcast: [What's AI by Louis Bouchard](https://open.spotify.com/show/4rKRJXaXlClkDyInjHkxq3), where you will learn about incredibly talented people in the field with inspiring stories sharing the knowledge they worked so hard to gather. A new one I really enjoy listening to that keeps me up to date is the [ThursdAI podcast](https://thursdai.news/) by my friend [Alex Volkov](https://twitter.com/altryne).

## Follow free online courses on YouTube<a name="youtubecourses"></a>
### Follow free online courses on YouTube
Here is a list of awesome courses available on YouTube that you should definitely follow and are 100% free.

* What's AI's LLM free course videos "[Train & Fine-Tune LLMs for Production Course by Activeloop, Towards AI & Intel Disruptor](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO4GrDnQanVcPlQUBuMd_pwRkILfc463G&si=QbXeHeDs5RSKH3nY)". "A playlist for our LLM course: Gen AI 360: Foundational Model Certification!"
* [Create a Large Language Model from Scratch with Python – Tutorial](https://youtu.be/UU1WVnMk4E8) - by [freeCodeCamp](https://twitter.com/freeCodeCamp). "Learn how to build your own large language model, from scratch. This course goes into the data handling, math, and transformers behind large language models. You will use Python."
* [LLM University (LLMU) from Cohere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1H6E8y_Sg&list=PLLalUvky4CLIpL4PkbTyf9DeXxJaZzEgU) - by [Cohere](https://twitter.com/cohere). LLM University (LLMU) is a set of comprehensive learning resources for anyone interested in natural language processing (NLP), from beginners to advanced learners.
* [The Attention Mechanism in Large Language Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCpWwDCDFQ&list=PLs8w1Cdi-zva4fwKkl9EK13siFvL9Wewf) - by Luis Serrano. In this video series, Luis explains the Transformer architecture going increasingly in depth. It is a very good overview and explanation of Transformers and the attention mechanism that I believe should be watched by all AI professionals.


## Read articles<a name="readarticles"></a>
### Read many articles
Here is a list of awesome articles available online that you should definitely read and are 100% free.
[Medium](https://whats-ai.medium.com/membership) is pretty much the best place to find great explanations, either on [Towards AI](https://pub.towardsai.net/) or [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/) publications. I also share my own articles there and I love using the platform. You can subscribe to Medium using my affiliated link [here](https://whats-ai.medium.com/membership) if this sounds interesting to you and if you'd like to support me at the same time!

## Practice, practice, and practice!<a name="practice"></a>
### Practice is key

The most important thing in programming is practice. And this applies to machine learning too. It can be hard to find a personal project to practice.

Fortunately, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) exists. This website is full of free courses, tutorials and competitions. You can join competitions for free and just download their data, read about their problem and start coding and testing right away! You can even earn money from winning competitions and it is a great thing to have on your resume. This may be the best way to get experience while learning a lot and even earn money! Another great opportunity for projects is to follow courses that are oriented towards a specific application like the [AI For trading course from Udacity](https://imp.i115008.net/Rymvkg).

You can also create teams for kaggle competition and learn with people! I suggest you join a community to find a team and learn with others, it is always better than alone. Check out the next section for that.


## Want to build language models/apps? Check this out (Now with LLMs!)!<a name="nlp"></a>
